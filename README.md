# OrthoXML Format

OrthoXML is a standard for sharing and exchaning orthology predictions. 
OrthoXML is designed broadly to allow the storage and comparison of orthology data from any ortholog database. It establishes a structure for describing orthology relationships while still allowing flexibility for database-specific information to be encapsulated in the same format.

## Issues and Activities

- OrthoXML version 0.4 is the current standard and is the version of the schema file `orthoxml.xsd` in the main branch of this repository. An interactive schema browser is available on https://orthoxml.org/0.4/orthoxml_doc_v0.4.html

- The branch 0.5 contains work towards a newer version.
